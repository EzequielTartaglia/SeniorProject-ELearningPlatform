# Senior Project

The goal of this project is to design and develop a robust educational web platform for a Chilean laboratory, tailored to support internal training and external educational offerings. The platform aims to streamline the delivery of educational content, improve learning outcomes, and support administrative efficiency. This project not only meets the clientâ€™s specific needs but also serves as a portfolio-worthy, real-world application of modern web technologies.
